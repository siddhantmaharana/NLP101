INTRODUCTION

5.

This is a securities class action on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise

acquired the common stock of DeVry between October 25, 2007 and August 13, 2010, inclusive (the

"Class Period"), against DeVry and certain of its officers and/or directors for violations of the 1934

Act. These claims are asserted against DeVry and certain of its officers and/or directors who made

materially false and misleading statements during the Class Period in press releases, analyst

conference calls, and filings with the SEC.

6.

DeVry is a global provider of educational services and the parent organization of

Advanced Academics, Becker Professional Education, Carrington College and Carrington College

California, Chamberlain College ofNursing, DeVry Brasil, DeVry University, and Ross University.

Through these institutions, DeVry offers a wide array of programs in business, healthcare and

technology and serves students in middle school through postsecondary education, as well as

accounting and finance professionals.

7.

During the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements

regarding the Company's business and financial results. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose

that the Company had been engaging in abusive and fraudulent recruiting and financial aid lending

practices, thereby increasing DeVry's student enrollment and revenues. As a result of defendants'

false statements, DeVry's common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period,

reaching a high of $74.25 per share on April 22, 2010.

8.

Then on August 13, 2010, after the market closed, the U. S. Department of Education

released data on federal student-loan repayment rates at the nation's colleges and universities. The

data showed that repayment rates were 54% at public colleges and 56% at private non-profit

intuitions, compared to just 36% at for-profit colleges. Specifically, the data showed that the

repayment rates at DeVry were a mere 38%.

2

Case: 1:10-cv-07031 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/01/10 Page 3 of 22 PageID #:3

9. On this news, the price of DeVry stock dropped 8.76%, or $3.74 per share, from a

closing price of $42.71 on August 13, 2010, to a closing price of $38.97 per share on August 16,

2010, the following trading day, on a 234% increase in trading volume.

10.	

The true facts, which were known by the defendants but concealed from the investing

public during the Class Period, were as follows:

(a)

the Company failed to disclose that it had engaged in improper and deceptive

recruiting and financial aid lending practices and, due to the government's scrutiny into the for-profit

sector, the Company would be unable to continue these practices in the future;

(b)

(c)

the Company failed to maintain proper internal controls;

many of the Company's programs were in jeopardy of losing their eligibility

for federal financial aid; and

(d)

as a result of the foregoing, defendants' statements regarding the Company's

financial performance and expected earnings were false and misleading and lacked a reasonable

basis when made.

11. As a result of defendants' false statements and omissions, DeVry common stock

traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. However, after the above revelations

seeped into the market, the Company's shares were hammered by massive sales, sending them down

approximately 46% from their Class Period high.

PARTIES

	12.	

Plaintiff Boca Raton Firefighters' and Police Pension Fund purchased DeVry

common stock as described in the attached certification and was damaged thereby.

13. As set forth above, DeVry is a global provider of career-oriented education services,

incorporated in the state of Delaware with principal executive offices located in Downers Grove,

Illinois.

Case: 1:10-cv-07031 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/01/10 Page 4 of 22 PageID #:4

14.

Defendant Daniel Hamburger, ("Hamburger") has served as President and Chief

Executive Officer of DeVry since July 2004. During the Class Period, while the price of DeVry

stock was artificially inflated, Hamburger sold 123,554 shares of DeVry stock at prices between

$55.45 and $57.78 per share, for insider trading proceeds totaling $7,094,805.

15.

Defendant Richard M. Gunst, ("Gunst") has served as Senior Vice President, Chief

Financial Officer and Treasurer of DeVry since July 2006.

16.

Defendant David J. Pauldine, ("Pauldine") has, at all relevant times, served as the

Executive Vice President of DeVry, and became the President of DeVry University, Inc. in July

2006. During the Class Period, while the price of DeVry stock was artificially inflated, Pauldine

sold 19,000 shares of DeVry stock at prices between $54.74 and $56.04 per share, for insidertrading

proceeds totaling $1,056,243.

17.

Defendants Hamburger, Gunst and Pauldine (the "Individual Defendants"), because

of their positions with the Company, possessed the power and authority to control the contents of

DeVry's quarterly reports, press releases and presentations to securities analysts, money and

portfolio managers, and institutional investors, i. e., the market. They were provided with copies of

the Company's reports and press releases alleged herein to be misleading prior to or shortly after

their issuance and had the ability and opportunity to prevent their issuance or cause them to be

corrected. Because of their positions with the Company, and their access to material non-public

information available to them but not to the public, the Individual Defendants knew that the adverse

facts specified herein had not been disclosed to and were being concealed from the public and that

the positive representations being made were then materially false and misleading. The Individual

Defendants are liable for the false statements pleaded herein.

Case: 1:10-cv-07031 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/01/10 Page 5 of 22 PageID #:5

FRAUDULENT SCHEME AND COURSE OF BUSINESS

18.

Defendants are liable for: (i) making false statements; or (ii) failing to disclose

adverse facts known to them about DeVry. Defendants' fraudulent scheme and course of business

that operated as a fraud or deceit on purchasers of DeVry common stock was a success, as it: (i)

deceived the investing public regarding DeVry's prospects and business; (ii) artificially inflated the

prices of DeVry commons tock; and (iii) caused plaintiff and other members of the Class to purchase

DeVry common stock at inflated prices and suffer economic loss when the revelations set forth

herein reached the market.

CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

19.

Plaintiff brings this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules

of Civil Procedure on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired DeVry common

stock during the Class Period (the "Class"). Excluded from the Class are defendants and their

families, the officers and directors of the Company, at all relevant times, members of their

immediate families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors, or assigns and any entity in

which defendants have or had a controlling interest.

20.

The members of the Class are so numerous that joinder of all members is

impracticable. The disposition of their claims in a class action will provide substantial benefits to

the parties and the Court. DeVry has more than 70 million shares of stock outstanding, owned by

hundreds if not thousands of persons.

21.

There is a well-defined community of interest in the questions of law and fact

involved in this case. Questions of law and fact common to the members of the Class which

predominate over questions which may affect individual Class members include:

(a)

(b)

whether the 1934 Act was violated by defendants;

whether defendants omitted and/or misrepresented material facts;

5

Case: 1:10-cv-07031 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/01/10 Page 6 of 22 PageID #:6

(c)

whether defendants' statements omitted material facts necessary to make the

statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

(d)

whether defendants knew or deliberately disregarded that their statements

were false and misleading;

(e)

whether the price of DeVry publicly traded securities was artificially inflated;

and

of damages.

(f)

the extent of damage sustained by Class members and the appropriate measure

22.

Plaintiff's claims are typical of those of the Class because plaintiff and the Class

sustained damages from defendants' wrongful conduct.

23.

Plaintiff will adequately protect the interests of the Class and has retained counsel

who are experienced in class action securities litigation. Plaintiff has no interests which conflict

with those of the Class.

24.

A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient

adjudication of this controversy.

is working with the Department of Justice, that it will cooperate fully with the

expect that DeVry's diversified array of educational offerings will continue to serve

58.

On June 10, 2010, Senator Tom Harkin, chair of the U. S. Senate's Health, Education,

Labor and Pensions Committee, announced that he would be holding a series of hearings to examine

federal spending at for-profit colleges. The press release provided in pertinent part:

Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
(HELP) Committee, today announced that he plans to hold a series of hearings to
examine federal education spending at for-profit higher education institutions. The
hearings will begin June 24th.

"In the past two years we have made major new investments to expand federal
financial aid," said Harkin. "Pell Grants and student loans now provide more than
$20 billion to for-profit higher education companies every year. We need to ensure
for-profit colleges are working well to meet the needs of students and not just
shareholders. We owe it to students and taxpayers to make sure these dollars are
being well spent."

Between 1998 and 2008 the for-profit sector has grown from 550,000 students to 1.8
million, a 225 percent increase. Students at for-profit institutions are borrowing
more, and more frequently, than their peers at non-profit schools, and according to
the Department of Education, one in five students who left a for-profit college in
2007 defaulted on their loan within three years.

The Committee will examine a broad range of issues related to the growing role of
the for-profit higher education sector, including the scope and rapid growth of the
federal investment in for-profit higher education and the corresponding opportunities
and risks for students and taxpayers. Details on the first hearing will be available in
the coming weeks.

59.

On June 16, 2010, the U. S. Department of Education announced that it was proposing

new tougher regulations on the industry designed to protect college students and taxpayers from

abusive or fraudulent practices.

60.

On June 24, 2010, the Senate held the first of its hearings entitled "Emerging Risk?

An Overview of the Federal Investment in For-Profit Education."

Case: 1:10-cv-07031 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/01/10 Page 14 of 22 PageID #:14

61.

By the end of June 2010, DeVry's stock was trading at $52.49, down 29% from its

Class Period peak of $74.25 on April 22, 2010.

62.

On July 15, 2010, DeVry submitted responses to questions from the United States

Senate Committee on Health, Education, Welfare and Pensions, which were raised by Senate

Committee members regarding testimony given before a hearing on "Emerging Risk? An Overview

of the Federal Investment in For-Profit Education."

63.

On August 3, 2010, news began to leak into the market concerning the findings from

an undercover operation conducted by the U.S. Government Accountability Office ("GAO") on

recruiting techniques used in the for-profit higher education industry.

64.

As a result, on August 3, 2010, DeVry stock declined $2.26, or 4.15%, from a closing

price of $54.50 on August 2, 2010, to a closing price of $52.24 on August 3, 2010. As news

continued to come out concerning details of the government's investigation and the anticipated

repercussions from the investigation on DeVry's business and prospects, DeVry stock continued to

decline.

65.

For example, on August 3, 2010, The New York Times  published an article entitled

"For-Profit Colleges Mislead Students, Report Finds," stating in pertinent part, as follows:

Undercover investigators posing as students interested in enrolling at 15 for-profit
colleges found that recruiters at four of the colleges encouraged prospective students
to lie on their financial aid applications — and all 15 misled potential students about
their programs' cost, quality and duration, or the average salary of graduates,
according to a federal report.

The report and its accompanying video are to be released publicly Wednesday by the
Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress, at an oversight
hearing on for-profit colleges by the Senate Committee on Health, Education Labor
and Pensions.

The report does not identify the colleges involved, but it includes both privately held
and publicly traded institutions in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania,
Texas and Washington, D.C. According to the report, the colleges in question were

14

Case: 1:10-cv-07031 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/01/10 Page 15 of 22 PageID #:15

chosen because they got nearly 90 percent of their revenues from federal aid, or they
were in states that are among the top 10 recipients of Title IV money.

The fast-growing for-profit education industry, which received more than $4 billion
in federal grants and $20 billion in Department of Education loans last year, has
become a source of concern, with many lawmakers suggesting that too much
taxpayer money is being used to generate profits for the colleges, instead of
providing students with a useful high-quality education.

The report gave specific instances in which some colleges encouraged fraud. At one
college in Texas, a recruiter encouraged the undercover investigator not to report
$250,000 in savings, saying it was "not the government's business." At a
Pennsylvania college, the financial representative told an undercover applicant who
had reported a $250,000 inheritance that he should have answered "zero" when asked
about money he had in savings — and then told him she would "correct" his form by
reducing the reported assets to zero, a change she later confirmed by e-mail and
voicemail.

At a college in California, an undercover investigator was encouraged to list three
nonexistent dependents on the financial aid application.

In addition to the colleges that encouraged fraud, all the colleges made some
deceptive statements. At one certificate program in Washington, for example, the
admissions representative told the undercover applicant that barbers could earn
$150,000 to $250,000 a year, when the vast majority earn less than $50,000 a year.
And at an associate degree program in Florida, the report said, a prospective student
was falsely told that the college was accredited by the same organization that
accredits Harvard and the University of Florida.

According to the report, courses in massage therapy and computer-aided drafting that
cost $14,000 at a California for-profit college were presented as good values, when
the same courses cost $520 at a local community college.

Six colleges in four states told the undercover applicants that they could not speak
with financial aid representatives or find out what grants and loans they were eligible
for until they completed enrollment forms agreeing to become a student and paid a
small application fee.

And one Florida college owned by a publicly traded company told an undercover
applicant that she needed to take a 50-question test, and answer 18 questions
correctly, to be admitted — and then had a representative sit with her and coach her
through the test. A representative at that college encouraged the applicant to sign an
enrollment contract, while assuring her it was not legally binding.

But in some instances, the report said, the applicants were given accurate and helpful
information, about likely salaries and not taking out more loans than they needed

66.

On August 4, 2010, the GAO issued its report detailing its findings. At the request of

Congress, the GAO undertook its investigation to determine if for-profit colleges engaged in

fraudulent, deceptive or otherwise questionable marketing practices. The GAO's report cited many

instances of abuse in the sector, finding that many of the companies in the industry — such as DeVry

— employed fraudulent and deceptive practices in their student recruitment, targeting students who

used federal financial aid to pay for their schooling. The study was presented at a Senate education

hearing held on August 4, 2010, as part of the ongoing government inquiry into the for-profit

education sector. This was the second of the Senate's hearings on the industry, and was entitled "For

Profit Schools: The Student Recruitment Experience."

67.

On August 6, 2010, DeVry announced that it had received a request for information

from the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions relating to the

Committee's ongoing hearings relating to private-sector colleges receiving Title IV financial aid.

Specifically, the request sought information to more accurately understand how DeVry's institutions

use Federal resources, including how they recruit and enroll students, set program price or tuition,

determine financial aid including private or institutional loans, track attendance, handle withdrawal

of students and return of Title IV dollars and manage compliance with the requirement that no more

than 90% of revenues come from Title IV dollars. In addition, the request also sought information

concerning the number of students who complete or graduate from programs offered by DeVry's

institutions, how many of those students find new work in their educational area, the debt levels of

students enrolling and completing programs and how DeVry tracks and manages the number of

students who risk default within the cohort default rate window.

16

Case: 1:10-cv-07031 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/01/10 Page 17 of 22 PageID #:17

68.

As a result, DeVry stock declined $3.13, or 6.14%, from a closing price of $50.96 on

August 5, 2010, to a closing price of $47.83 on August 6, 2010, on a 108% increase in trading

volume.

69.

On August 12, 2010, DeVry issued a press release reporting financial results for its

fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year ended June 30, 2010. The Company reported net income of

$71.6 million or $0.99 diluted earnings per share and revenue of $506.7 million, for the quarter. The

Company reported net income of $279 million or $3.87 diluted earnings per share and revenue of

$1,915 million for the year.

70.

Thereafter, DeVry stock declined $0.48 or 1.05% from a closing price of $45.79 on

August 11, 2010, to a closing price of $45.31 on August 12, 2010. On August 13, 2010, DeVry

stock declined another $2.60, or 5.74%, to a closing price of $42.71. Although defendants were

reporting seemingly positive financial results, as news continued to come out concerning details of

the government's investigation and the anticipated repercussions from the investigation on DeVry's

business and prospects, DeVry stock continued to decline. But for defendants' false and misleading

statements, the stock would have declined even further.

THE TRUTH IS REVEALED

71.

On August 13, 2010, after the market closed, the U.S. Department of Education

released data on student-loan repayment rates at the nation's colleges and universities. The data

showed that the repayment rates were 54% at public colleges and universities, 56% at private

nonprofit institutions and 36% at for-profit colleges. The data showed that the repayment rates at

DeVry's schools were just 38%.

72.

In addition, the U. S. Department of Education proposed new regulations for programs

to continue to be eligible to receive federal financial aid. The tests for eligibility would be based on

repayment rates and debt-to-income loads. Under the proposed "gainful employment" regulations,

17

Case: 1:10-cv-07031 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/01/10 Page 18 of 22 PageID #:18

programs would need to have a repayment rate of at least 45% to continue to be eligible for federal

financial aid. The regulations if adopted will go into effect in July 2011. Based on the proposed

regulations, many of DeVry's programs are in jeopardy of losing their financial aid status.

73. On this news, the price of DeVry's stock decreased an additional $3.74, or 8.76%,

from a closing price of $42.71 on August 13, 2010, to a closing price of $38.97 on August 16, 2010,

the next trading day, on a 234% increase in trading volume.

74.	

The true facts, which were known by the defendants but concealed from the investing

public during the Class Period, were as follows:

(a)

the Company failed to disclose that it had engaged in improper and deceptive

recruiting and financial aid lending practices and, due to the government's scrutiny into the for-profit

sector, the Company would be unable to continue these practices in the future;

(b)

(c)

the Company failed to maintain proper internal controls;

many of the Company's programs were in jeopardy of losing their eligibility

for federal financial aid; and

(d)

as a result of the foregoing, defendants' statements regarding the Company's

financial performance and expected earnings were false and misleading and lacked a reasonable

basis when made.

75. As a result of defendants' false statements and omissions, DeVry common stock

traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. After the above revelations seeped into

the market, however, the Company's shares were hammered by massive sales, sending them down

approximately 46% from their Class Period high.

ADDITIONAL SCIENTER ALLEGATIONS

	76.	

As alleged herein, defendants acted with scienter in that defendants knew that the

public documents and statements issued or disseminated in the name of the Company were

18

	
Case: 1:10-cv-07031 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/01/10 Page 19 of 22 PageID #:19

materially false and misleading; knew that such statements or documents would be issued or

disseminated to the investing public; and knowingly and substantially participated or acquiesced in

the issuance or dissemination of such statements or documents as primary violations of the federal

securities laws. As set forth elsewhere herein in detail, defendants, by virtue of their receipt of

information reflecting the true facts regarding DeVry, their control over, and/or receipt and/or

modification of DeVry allegedly materially misleading misstatements and/or their associations with

the Company which made them privy to confidential proprietary information concerning DeVry,

participated in the fraudulent scheme alleged herein.

LOSS CAUSATION/ECONOMIC LOSS

77.

During the Class Period, as detailed herein, the defendants made false and misleading

statements and engaged in a scheme to deceive the market and a course of conduct that artificially

inflated the price of DeVry common stock and operated as a fraud or deceit on Class Period

purchasers of DeVry stock by misrepresenting the Company's business and prospects. Later, when

the defendants' prior misrepresentations and fraudulent conduct became apparent to the market,

through a series of partial disclosures, the price of DeVry stock fell precipitously, as the prior

artificial inflation came out of the price over time. As a result of their purchases of DeVry common

stock during the Class Period, plaintiff and other members of the Class suffered economic loss, i.e.,

damages, under the federal securities laws when the above-described revelations reached the market

and the artificial inflation was removed.

NO SAFE HARBOR

78.

DeVry's verbal "Safe Harbor" warnings accompanying its oral forward-looking

statements ("FLS") issued during the Class Period were ineffective to shield those statements from

liability.

19

Case: 1:10-cv-07031 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/01/10 Page 20 of 22 PageID #:20

79.

The defendants are also liable for any false or misleading FLS pleaded because, at the

time each FLS was made, the speaker knew the FLS was false or misleading and the FLS was

authorized and/or approved by an executive officer of DeVry who knew that the FLS was false.

None of the historic or present tense statements made by defendants were assumptions underlying or

relating to any plan, projection or statement of future economic performance, as they were not stated

to be such assumptions underlying or relating to any projection or statement of future economic

performance when made, nor were any of the projections or forecasts made by defendants expressly

related to or stated to be dependent on those historic or present tense statements when made.

COUNT

For Violation of §10(B) of The 1934 Act And Rule 10b-5

Against All Defendants

Plaintiff incorporates ¶¶1-79 by reference.

During the Class Period, defendants disseminated or approved the false statements

80.

81.

specified above, which they knew or deliberately disregarded were misleading in that they contained

misrepresentations and failed to disclose material facts necessary in order to make the statements

made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

82.

Defendants violated § 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule l Ob-5 in that they:

(a)

(b)

employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud;

made untrue statements of material facts or omitted to state material facts

necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were

made, not misleading; or

(c)

engaged in acts, practices and a course of business that operated as a fraud or

deceit upon plaintiff and others similarly situated in connection with their purchases of DeVry

common stock during the Class Period.

20

Case: 1:10-cv-07031 Document #: 1 Filed: 11/01/10 Page 21 of 22 PageID #:21

83.

Plaintiff and the Class have suffered damages in that, in reliance on the integrity of

the market, they paid artificially inflated prices for DeVry common stock and sustained substantial

losses when the artificial inflation was removed as a results of the disclosures described herein.

Plaintiff and the Class would not have purchased DeVry common stock at the prices they paid, or at

all, if they had been aware that the market prices had been artificially and falsely inflated by

defendants' misleading statements.

COUNT II

For Violation of §20(A) of The 1934 Act

Against All Defendants

Plaintiff incorporates ¶¶1-79 by reference.

The Individual Defendants acted as controlling persons of DeVry within the meaning

84.

85.

of §20(a) of the 1934 Act. By reason of their positions with the Company, and their ownership of

DeVry common stock, the Individual Defendants had the power and authority to cause DeVry to

engage in the wrongful conduct complained of herein. DeVry controlled the Individual Defendants

and all of its employees. By reason of such conduct, defendants are liable pursuant to §20(a) of the

1934 Act.
