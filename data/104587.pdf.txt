SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

	2	

1.	

This is a stockholder class action brought by plaintiff  on behalf of holders ofcommon

3 stock of RAE Systems Inc. ("RAE" or the "Company") against RAE, Battery Ventures ("Battery

4 Ventures") and certain RAE officers and directors. This action arises out of defendants' violations of

5 state law and sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") and

6 U.& Securities and Exchange Commission .("SEC") Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder in

7 connection with their attempts to sell RAE via an . unfair process. to Battery Ventures for $1.60 per

8 share (the "Proposed Acquisition"). This action see ps to enjoin defendants from farther breaching

9 their fiduciary duties in their pursuit of a sale of the Company at an unfair price through an unfair

10 and self-serving process to Battery Ventures.

11	

2.	

In pursuing the unlawful plan to induce RAE shareholders to approve the Proposed

12 Acquisition via an unfair and uninformed process, each of the defendants violated applicable law by

13 directly breaching or aiding the other defendants' breaches of their fiduciary duties of loyalty, due

14 care, candor, diligence, independence, good faith, and fair dealing. The officers and directors of

15 RAE have decided to pursue their own interests, seeking to cash in on valuable change-in-control

16 agreements or prestigious positions in the post-Proposed Acquisition company at the expense of

17 RAE's public shareholders.

18	

3..	

On July 23, 2009, RAE's stock traded as high as $1.90, more than 18% higher than

19 the Proposed Acquisition value. Now, however, the defendants are attempting to sell the Company

20 for a low ball offer at an inopportune time and before RAE shareholders can take full advantage of

21 the value that the Company has to offer to the shareholders. Despite recent difficulties caused by the

22 global recession, the long term prospects for RAE's services and finances are favorable. RAE has

23 stated as much in recent press releases. For example, on August 4, 2010, defendant Robert 1. Chen

24 ("Chen"), chairman, president, and chief executive officer, stated that the Company had "strong first

25 half revenue in the Americas." In the same press release, the Company also reported $23.3 . million

26 in revenues, an increase of 17% over the second. quarter of 2009.

27	

4.	

The timing of the Proposed Acquisition has been engineered to take advantage of a

28 recent decline in the trading price of RAE's shares caused by the nationwide recession and a Foreign

1 Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") investigation being conducted by the SEC and U.S. Department  of

2 Justice ("DQJ" ). The Company has set aside millions of dollars for a potential settlement. The

3 uncertainty related to these investigations and amount of any judgment or settlement has depressed

4 the Company's stock value, making the premium here illusory.

5	

5.	

As the Company is being sold out from under its shareholders, its two co-founders

6 have worked to secure a more lucrative consideration for themselves. Defendants Chen and Peter C.

7 Hsi ("Hsi") convinced Battery Ventures to .provide them with 30% of the outstanding capital stock of

8 the go-forward company  in exchange for a combined 13,392,857 shares of RAE common stock.

9 Called the "Rollover Holders," Chen and Hsi have agreed, among other things, to contribute their

10 Rollover Shares to the go-forward company immediately prior to the effective date of the Agreement

11 and Plan of Merger, attached as .Exhibit 2.1 to the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on

12 September 20, 2010 ("Merger Agreement"), in exchange for  a materially different consideration

13 than the rest of the shareholders. In other words, Chen and Hsi secured their own lucrative

14 alternative personal agreement from Battery Ventures and will profit from the Company's continued

15 success, while the remaining shareholders are left with a meager $1.60 per share. This is a benefit

16 not available to RAE's common shareholders. In pursuit to obtain this benefit, defendants Chen and

17 Hsi entered voting agreements with Battery Ventures under which they have agreed to vote their

18 shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Moreover, Chen and Hsi will remain on

19 . the Board of Directors ("Board") of RAE after the acquisition and will also remain as stockholders in

20 RAE. Due to these inherent conflicts of interest, RAE's Board purportedly formed a "disinterested"

21 Special Committee to approve the transaction and recommend that RAE shareholders approve . it.

22 However, the committee merely rubber-stamped the Proposed Acquisition.

23	

6.	

In exchange for the lucrative benefits being offered to Hsi and Chen, but not the Class

24 (as defined herein), the defendants agreed to an unlevel playing field. For example, the Company

25 agreed to a termination fee provision whereby RAE must pay $3.39 million (plus expenses) to

26 Battery Ventures in the event of a higher offer. This amount represents an extraordinarily large

27 4.6% of the total cash consideration being paid to the Company's shareholders who will not be

28 equity participants in the go-forward company. The ten-nination fee is all the more troublesome

I given the unfair process that was undertaken. Moreover, the fact that  the Company has now

2 received  a higher offer  of $1.80 per share from an undisclosed third party means that the termination

3 fee to be paid to Battery Ventures  is depriving the Company's shareholders of consideration for their

4 shares.

5	

7.	

In furtherance of their attempt to secure shareholder approval for the unfair Proposed

6 Acquisition, on October 21, 2010, the Individual Defendants and RAE issued a materially false and

7 misleading Preliminary Proxy Statement on Form PREMI4A (the . "Proxy").. The Proxy, which

8 recommends that RAE shareholders vote in favor of the Proposed. Acquisition, omits and/or

9 misrepresents material information about the unfair sales process for the Company, the unfair

10 consideration offered in the Proposed Acquisition, and the actual intrinsic value of the Company.

11 Among other information, th&Proxy omits and/or misrepresents the following material information

12 in contravention of sectionsl4(a) and 20(a) of the 1934 Act regarding:

13	

(a)	

key financial information used by the Special Committee and its bankers in

14 order to value the Company and the fairness of the Proposed Acquisition, including the key inputs

15 and data underlying the financial analyses and the full  set of financial projections; and

16	

(b)	

other strategic alternatives considered by the Board and the valuations placed

17 on those other strategic alternatives.

is	

8.	

As explained herein, the foregoing information is material to the impending decision

19 of RAE's shareholders whether or not to vote in favor of the Proposed Acquisition. As such,

20 defendants' violations of sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the 1934 Act threaten shareholders with

21 irreparable harm for which money damages are not an adequate alternate remedy. Thus, plaintiff

22 seeks injunctive relief to ensure that defendants cure their violations of fiduciary duty and sections

23 14(a) and 20(a) before RAE's shareholders are asked to vote on the Proposed Acquisition and that

24 defendants are not permitted to seek shareholder support of the Proposed Acquisition without

25 complying with their duty under the federal securities laws to provide shareholders with all material.

26 information about the sales process, the proposed consideration, and the Company's intrinsic value.

27	

9.	

Because defendants dominate and control the business and corporate affairs of RAE,

28 they have access to nonpublic private corporate information concerning RAE's assets, business, and

1 future prospects. Thus, there exists an unbalance and disparity of knowledge and economic power

2 between their and the public shareholders of RAE, which makes it inherently unfair for them to

3 execute and pursue any Proposed Acquisition agreement under which they will reap disproportionate

4 benefits to the exclusion of maximizing stockholder value. Nonetheless, instead of attempting to

5 engage in a fair process, untainted by self-dealing, defendants spent a substantial effort tailoring the
6 Proposed Acquisition to meet their specific needs and the needs of Battery Ventures.

7.	

10.	

If consummated, the Proposed Acquisition will result in RAE's shareholders losing

8 the value of their investment in RAE. The-proposed consideration reflects an inadequate premium to

9 the trading price of the Company's common stock prior to the announcement of the Proposed

10 Acquisition given that RAE has promising finances and products.

11	

11.	

In short, the Proposed Acquisition is designed to unlawfully divest RAE's public

12 stockholders of the future growth potential of the Coinpanyby engaging in an unfair process riddled

13 with self-dealing.

14	

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

	15	

12.	

This Court has jurisdiction over all claims asserted herein pursuant to section 27 of

16	

the 1934.

	 Act for violations of sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the 1934 Act and SEC Rule 14a-9

17 promulgated thereunder. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant

18 to 28 U.S.C. section 1331.

19	

13.	

Venue is proper in this District because RAE has its principle place of business in this

20 District. Plaintiff's claims arose in this District because it is where most of the actionable conduct

21 took place, where most of the documents are electronically stored, where the evidence exists, and

22 where virtually all the witnesses are located and available to testify at the jury trial permitted on

23 these claims in this Court. Moreover, each of the Individual Defendants, as Company officers and/or

24 directors, has extensive contacts with this District.

INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS' FIDUCIARY DUTIES

26,	

Under Delaware law, the directors and officers of a publicly traded corporation have

24 fiduciary duties of loyalty, good faith, and care to shareholders. To diligently comply with these

25 duties, neither the directors nor the officers may take any action that:

26	

27	

(a)	

(b)	

adversely affects the value provided to the corporation's shareholders;

will discourage, inhibit, or deter alternative offers to purchase control of the

28 corporation or its assets;

	1	

2	

(c)	

(d)	

contractually prohibits themselves from complying with their fiduciary duties;

will otherwise adversely affect their duty to secure the best value reasonably

3 available under the circumstances for the corporation's shareholders; and/or

4	

(e)	

will provide the directors .and/or officers with preferential treatment at the

5 expense of, or separate from, the public shareholders.

6	

27.	

In accordance with their duties of loyalty and good faith, the Individual Defendants,

7 as directors and/or officers of RAE, are obligated under Delaware law to refrain from:

8	

.9 divided;

10	

(a)	

participating in any transaction where the directors' or officers' loyalties are

(b)	

.participating in any transaction where the directors or officers receive, or are

11 entitled to receive, a personal financial benefit not equally shared by the public shareholders of the

12 corporation; and/or

13	

(c)	

unjustly enriching themselves at the expense or to the detriment of the public

14 shareholders.

15	

28.	

Defendants, separately and together, in connection with the Proposed Acquisition, are

16 knowingly or recklessly violating their fiduciary duties and/or aiding and abetting such breaches,.

17 including the Individual Defendants' duties of loyalty, good faith, and independence owed to

18 plaintiff and other public shareholders of RAE. Certain of the Individual Defendants stand on both

19 sides of the transaction, are engaging in self-dealing, are obtaining for themselves personal benefits,

i

20 including personal financial benefits not shared equally by plaintiff or the Class. Certain RAE

21 executives are also retaining their prestigious and lucrative positions and compensation at the post-

22 Proposed Acquisition company. These executives have managed to secure for themselves

.23 substantial employment at the expense of the shareholders' best interests. Accordingly, the Proposed

24 Acquisition will benefit the Individual Defendants in significant ways not shared with Class

25 members. As a result of the Individual Defendants' self-dealing and divided loyalties, neither

26 plaintiff nor the Class will receive adequate or fair value for their RAE common stock in the

27 Proposed Acquisition.

	1	

29.	

Because the Individual Defendants are knowingly or recklessly breaching their duties

2 of loyalty, good faith, and independence in connection  with the Proposed Acquisition, the burden of

3 proving the inherent or entire fairness of the Proposed Acquisition, including all aspects of its

4 negotiation, structure, price and terms, is placed upon defendants as a matter of  law.

5	

THE FLAWED SALE PROCESS

	6	

30.	

In November 2009, unbeknownst to the Board, defendants Chen and Guasman began

7 discussing a potential sale of the Company with Battery Ventures. Also in November 2009, the

8 Company received inquiries from other private equity firms expressing an interest in a transaction to.

9 acquire the Company. However, before the Board considered the overtures from the private equity

10 firms, on January 27, 2010, Battery Ventures and RAE entered anon-disclosure agreement. That

11. same day, defendants Chen, Guasman, and Hsi gave a presentation to Battery Ventures about the

12 Company's business and outlook. From the beginning of their discussions with Battery Ventures,

13 defendants Chen, Gausman, and Hsi favored Battery Ventures over other suitors because of its desire

14 to retain their services and the potential for an . equity position in the go-forward company.

15	

31.	

Thereafter, on February 3, 2010, three months after the Company's officers had their

16 discussions with Battery Ventures, the Board finally convened to discuss Battery Ventures's interest

17 in acquiring the Company and the process that had already taken place. At the meeting the Board

18 formed a Strategic Planning Committee, consisting of defendants Power and Wang. Defendants.

19 Chen, Guasman, and Hsi were purportedly told to stop discussions regarding an acquisition by

20 Battery Ventures. However, the order fiorn the Board to cease discussions had little practical effect

21 as detailed below.

22	

32.	

In February 2010, the Strategic Planning Committee created a three-year business

23 plan to provide suitors with the Company's business prospects. The material information in this

24 business plan is not disclosed in the Proxy for the Company's shareholders to review.

25	

33.	

On March 12, 2010, Battery Ventures made a proposal to acquire the Company at

26 $1.45 per share. That offer included a provision where defendants Chen and Hsi would exchange a

27 substantial portion of their 30% ownership in the Company for an equity position in the go-forward

28 business. Following this offer, the Board formed a Special Committee that included defendants Lu

Case5:10-cv-04944-PVT Document1 Filed1 1/01/10 Page9 of 26

1 and Wang. The Special committee retained UBS Securities LLC ("UBS") as its financial advisor.

2 in addition to Battery Ventures offer, the Company received unsolicited offers from other interested

3 parties in March 2010.

4	

34.	

On April 2, 2010, despite claiming that the Special Committee was "independent,"

5 defendants Chen and Guasman met with the Special Committee to discuss the Company's options as

6 a publicly-traded and private company. Also on April 2, 2010, the Special Committee and

7 defendants Chen . and Guasman were updated on the SEC and DOJ's investigation of the FCPA. The

8 Proxy, however, fails to disclose whether the Special Committee considered whether the resolution

9 of the FCPA issue would provide the Company's shareholders with an opportunity to maximize the

10 Company's value in any acquisition.

11	

35.	

By April 14, 2010, the Special Committee had decided to provide Battery Ventures

12 with due diligence before any other suitor and before any "market check" had occurred. About a

13 week later, on April 21, 2010, UBS created a list of prospective acquirers for a purported "market

14 check. On April 27, 2010, Battery Ventures was provided a data room to review confidential

15 information that had not been provided to any other suitors, despite the Individual Defendants

16 knowledge that other suitors existed.

17	

36.	

In May 2010, and while Battery Ventures was already conducting due diligence, the

18 Special Committee began considering other prospective acquirers. Meetings and in-person

19 presentations were conducted with prospective acquirers in May and June 2010. However, these

20 meetings were not conducted by the Special Committee. Defendants Chen, Hsi, and Guasman

21 conducted the presentations and continued to lead discussions with the potential suitors. Moreover,

22 on May 6 and 7, 2010, only defendant Chen and his advisor attended meetings with Battery Ventures

23 at its offices. The meetings concerned RAE and the future prospects of the Company.

24	

37.	

Despite the fact that there were multiple other suitors interested in the Company, on

25 May 20, 2010, the Special Committee authorized the Company to reimburse expenses incurred by

26 Battery Ventures,

27	

38,	

On June 2, 2010, UBS provided the potential acquirers with a date of June 15, 2010,

28 to submit an offer to acquire the Company. As such, on June 15, 2010, eleven bidders submitted

1 offers. Parties identified in the Proxy as Bidders A and B made offers for more consideration than

2 Battery Ventures's offer. Likewise, Bidder C's offer provided a price range of $1.25 to $1.50.

3	

39.	

To comply with the previous granting to Battery Ventures of a "most favored nation"

4 provision that would allow it to obtain an amended standstill agreement if the Company entered a

5 more beneficial standstill agreement with a different party, on July 29, 2010, Battery Ventures

6 standstill agreement was modified based on the terms negotiated with other bidders.

7	

40.	

On August 11, 2010, Battery Ventures's counsel provided the Company with a draft

8 merger agreement. The draft merger agreement contained a termination fee of 4.6% and a provision

9 that required the Company to reimburse expenses if the merger agreement was not approved.

10	

41.	

On August 13, 2010, Bidder A still was interested in acquiring the Company, but

11 asked for certain conditions to be met before any acquisition. Those conditions included settlement

12 of the FCPA matters with the SEC and DOJ, and for certain asset divestures. If the Company met

13 these conditions, Bidder A's offer range would provide shareholders 7%-16% more value than

14 Battery Ventures's offer. Given that defendant Guasman had stated the FCPA matter would come to

15 a "conclusion soon," a short waiting period in order to meet Bidder A's conditions was reasonable in

16 order to maximize shareholder value. However, in response to Bidder A's offer and conditions, the

17 Special Committee told Bidder A that it must revise its conditions or else the Special Committee

18 would not continue negotiations with it.

19	

42.	

On August 17, 2010, Battery Ventures asked for the Company to allow it to discuss

20 certain matters with Rollover Holders related to terms of their involvement in a newly formed entity

21 if the Proposed Acquisition was consummated. The Company approved the request, and Battery

22 Ventures entered into discussions with defendants Chen and Hsi and raised its offer to $1.60 per

23 share. On August 20, 2010, the Company entered into an exclusivity agreement with Battery

24 Ventures. Then, on August 23, 2010, the Company authorized defendants Chen and Hsi to conduct

25 negotiations with Battery Ventures on terms and conditions for their equity in the go-forward

26 company and employment agreements with defendants Chen  (and his wife) and Hsi.

27	

43.	

The Individual Defendants executed the Merger Agreement on September 19, 2010

28 and announced the Proposed Acquisition before the market opened on September 20, 2010. The

1 next day, the Board received an offer of $1.80 per share from an undisclosed third party. In

2 response, the Board continued going forward with the Proposed Acquisition, but also decided. to

3 enter a confidentiality agreement with the third party. The undisclosed company began due

4 diligence on October 5, 2010. Now, if there is a change in recommendation and the undisclosed

5 company acquires RAE it will trigger the termination fee payment, which will waste value that the

RAE Systems Signs Definitive Agreement to Be Acquired by Battery Ventures
for $1.60 per Share

RAE Systems to Bold Conference Call Today at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time

RAE Systems Inc. (NYSE Amex: RAE), a leader in delivering innovative sensor
solutions to serve industrial, energy, environmental, and government safety markets
worldwide, signed a definitive agreement to be acquired for $1.60 per share in cash
by an affiliate of Battery Ventures, a multi-stage investment firm focused on
technology and innovation worldwide. The purchase price represents a premium of
approximately 53.8% over RAE Systems' closing share price on September 17, 2010,
and a premium of approximately 85.1 % over RAE Systems' average closing share
price for the 30 trading days ending on September 17, 2010.

This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the
approval of RAE Systems' stockholders. There is no financing condition to the
transaction.

"Over the years, we have built a strong reputation in the safety industry, a
quality, diverse product and technology portfolio, and a dedicated, result-oriented
employee base, all of which are contemplated in this transaction," said Robert Chen,
RAE Systems president and chief executive officer. "After an extensive review of
our strategic alternatives, the special committee of our board  of directors has
determined that this transaction provides for the best value to our stockholders. RAE

Jesse Feldman, Battery Ventures Partner, stated, "RAE Systems has
significant long-term market growth potential, and we are excited to partner with the
company on driving this growth both organically and through strategic acquisitions.
Our prior experience and growing interest in industrial technologies makes RAE
Systems a natural investment for Battery. We are eager to support the company
through its next phase of evolution and look forward to working with RAE's talented
employee base, valuable customer and partner ecosystems, and industry leading
technology platform to get there."

A special committee of the RAE Systems Board of Directors and the
disinterested members of the board have unanimously approved the agreement and
recommend RAE Systems' stockholders approve the transaction..

The company will file a proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and a shareholder meeting will be held within 60 days following the
SEC's review. Management will hold a conference call to discuss this transaction
today, September 20, at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time). Access
instructions for the call are included later in this release.

After the completion of this transition, the RAE Systems board of directors
will include Mr. Chen and Dr. Peter C. Hsi, co-founders of RAE Systems, who will
also remain as stockholders in RAE Systems, as well as Mr. Feldman and Morgan
Jones of Battery Ventures.

UBS Investment Bank is acting as financial advisor to the Special Committee
of the Board of RAE Systems, and Fenwick & West LLP, is acting as legal advisor to
the Special Committee.

The premium being offered in the Proposed Acquisition drastically undervalues the

16 Company's assets and business prospects. For example, the Individual Defendants agreed to sell the

17 Company before any settlement has been announced with the SEC and Department of Justice related

IS to the FCPA investigation announced in 2008. On November 4, 2009, defendant Gausman said that

19 the FCPA investigation would conclude shortly and stated "I think [we are] in the process of

20 hopefully resolving [the] FCPA investigation.... And as we wrap this thing up, we expect [legal

21 . expenses] to trail off even further." In the Company's second quarter conference call for fiscal 2010,

22 defendant Gausman believed the investigation into violations of the FCPA would be completed

23 before the end of 2010. However, despite the imminence of this settlement, the Individual

24 Defendants are selling now while the stock is still depressed. Indeed, analysts on the September 20,

25 2010, conference call inquired as to the rush to enter into the Proposed Acquisition given the

26 overhang of the FCPA investigation:

Why did you wait until -- why did you do this before announcing your settlement
with the government, with the FCPA investigation?

Randy Gausman - RAE Systems .Inc. - YP, CFO

Well, this process has been underway for quite a period of time. Although, as we
indicated at the end of our third-quarter conference call, we expect the resolution to
the FCPA matter to come to a conclusion soon. This process sort of tracked on  a
parallel path and came to fruition at this time. Again, as I said previously, the.Board
of Directors unanimously approved this transaction for today's announcement.

46.	

Despite the ongoing FCPA investigations the Company's prospects have recently

7 improved and the Company's stock value is posed for a surge. For the second straight quarter, the

8 Company reported rising revenues and profitable quarters. For example, on May 5, 2010, the

9 Company reported revenue of $1$.8 million, the second highest first quarter revenue in the

10 Company's history. Also on May 5, 2010, defendant Chen stated "[w]e  have positioned RAE

I I Systems to be a leading innovator of safety and security products to deliver wireless real-time data

12 enabling our customers to make better decisions faster."  Then on August 4, 2010, the Company

13 reported that its first half revenue exceeded the comparable quarters for 2009 by 8%_

PRECLUSIVE DEAL PROTECTION DEVICES

47.	

In order to Meet their fiduciary duties, the Individual Defendants are obligated to

16 explore transactions that will maximize shareholder value, and not structure a preferential deal for

17 themselves. Due to Individual Defendants' eagerness to enter into an acquisition with Battery

18 Ventures, they failed to implement a process to obtain the maximum price for shareholders. As a

19 result of the Individual Defendants' conduct, RAE's public stockholders have been and will continue

20 to be denied the fair process and arm's-length negotiated terms to which they are entitled in a sale of

21 their Company.

22	

48.	

The Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to a $3.39

23 million termination fee that an acquirer will have to pay Battery Ventures rather than returning that

24 value to the shareholders of RAE. The termination fee is equal to $0.07 per RAE share. A

25 termination fee of that proportion is unjust, prevents the shareholders from receiving the inherent

26 value of their shares, and wastes shareholder value on excessive and preclusive deal protection

27 measures, especially since the Board did not obtain a post-closing go shop period. This is of

28 particular concern now that a superior offer has emerged offering an increase in value of more than
-12-

Case5:10-cv-04944-PVT Document1 Filed1 1/01/10 Page14 of 26

1 11% for each share. Instead of attempting to negotiate a transaction reflecting the highest price

2 reasonably available for the Company's shareholders, the Individual Defendants spent considerable

3 effort tailoring the Proposed Acquisition to meet the needs of the Rollover Defendants.

.4	

49.	

On September 20, 2010,

. the Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC, wherein it

5 disclosed the Merger Agreement. The announcement and filing reveal that the Proposed. Acquisition

6 is the product of a flawed sale process and, unless increased, would be consummated at an unfair

7 value.

8	

50.	

Under section 4.3 of the Merger Agreement, RAE is subject to a no solicitation clause

9 that prohibits the Company from seeking a superior offer for its shareholders. Section 4.3 restricts

10 RAE's ability to:

11	

12	

13	

14	

15	

1.6	

(i) solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the communication, making,
submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (ii)
furnish any information regarding any of the Acquired Corporations to any Person in
connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry;
(iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal; or (v) execute or enter into any letter of intent with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or any other Acquisition Agreement

51.	

Though the Merger Agreement ostensibly has a "fiduciary out" provision that allows

17 the Company to negotiate with other bidders, this provision is actually illusory. In order to negotiate

18 with any other suitors, the potential acquirer would first have to make an unsolicited offer that RAE

19 must supply to Battery Ventures  so that Battery Ventures has the right to match the superior offer

20 within two days. Without access to non-public information, which the Company is prevented from

21 offering under the Merger Agreement, no other bidder will emerge to make such an offer.

22	

23	

THE MATERIALLY MISLEADIN G PROXY

52.	

In order to secure shareholder approval of this unfair deal, defendants filed the

24 materially misleading Proxy on October 21, 2010. The Proxy, which recommends that RAE's

25 shareholders vote in favor of the Proposed Acquisition., omits and/or misrepresents material

26 information about the unfair sale process, the unfair consideration, and the true intrinsic value of the

27 Company. Specifically the Proxy omits/or misrepresents the material information set forth below in

28 contravention of sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the 1934 Act.

The strategic alternatives available to the Company.  Defendants' failure to disclose

2 all material information about the strategic alternatives that purportedly weregiven consideration by

3 the Board, the Special Committee, and Company management renders, among other sections, the

4 following text of pages 23 of the Proxy materially misleading:

In the course of reaching that determination and recommendation, the Special
Committee and our board of directors considered a number of potentially positive
factors in its deliberations, including the following:

The business market and execution risks associated with remaining independent and
successfully implementing a stand-alone strategy given the highly competitive nature
of our industry, our relatively small size 'and resources as compared to our
competitors, and other factors ....

54.	

This statement is materially misleading to shareholders because it does not provide

12 any analysis of how the potential alternative or remaining independent compares financially to the

13 Proposed Acquisition. This information is material because shareholders are entitled to know why

14 the Special Committee preferred and pursued one strategic alternative over others, as well as the

15 nature and financial viability of those other alternatives.

16	

55.	

Theftnancialprojections relied  on by UBS in its Discounted Cash Flow  ("DCF

17 Analysis.  Defendants admit that UBS conducted its DCF analysis by "calcuiate[ing] a range of

18 implied present values (as of September 3.0, 2010) of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash

19 flows that RAE Systems was forecasted to generate from October 1, 2010 until December 31, 2014,"

20 as stated in the Proxy at page 29. The estimated future cash flows of RAE Systems, in turn, are

21 derived from the financial projections that UBS relied on in its analysis. These financial projections

22 are not disclosed in the discussion of the financial projections on page 29 of the Proxy. Without this

23 information, shareholders will be unable to independently assess the factors underlying the analysis

24 and the primary assumptions used by UBS in the analysis.

56.	

The inputs and data underlying UBS s DCFAnalysis.  In defendants' discussion of

26 UBS's DCF analysis on page 29 of the Proxy, defendants fail to disclose (i) how and why the

27 discount rate range of 20% to 25% was selected; and (ii) how and why the estimated range of

28 EBITDA terminal value multiples of 8.Ox to 9.Ox were selected.. This information is material

3 as set forth in the Proxy, is an adequate measure of the value of these cash flows.

The inputs and data underlying UBS's Selected Public Companies Analysis. In

5 defendants' discussion of UBS's Selected Public Companies Analysis on page 27-28 of the Proxy,

6 defendants fail to disclose: (i) the criteria for selection of the comparable companies; (ii) how the

7 summary statistics for each company, including the specific equity and enterprise values for each

8 company; and (iii) the implied multiples for each company. This information is material because the

9 Selected Public Companies Analysis assesses the public market value of the Company as compared

10 to its comparables, and, without the information set forth above, shareholders are unable to

11 independently assess whether UBS's analysis, as set forth in the Proxy, is an adequate measure of

12 this value assessment.

13	

58.	

The data and inputs underlying UBS's Selected Transactions Analysis. 

In

14 defendants' discussion of UBS's Selected Transactions Analysis at page 28-29 of the Proxy,

15 defendants fail to disclose: (i) the criteria for selection of the transactions used; (ii) the size of each

16 transaction; and (iii) the nature of the consideration for each transaction. This  information is

17 material because the Selected Transactions Analysis assesses the consideration offered in the

18 Proposed Acquisition as compared to comparable transactions, and, without the information set forth

19 above, shareholders are unable to independently assess whether UBS's analysis, as set forth in the

20 Proxy, is an adequate measure of this value assessment.

59.	

The Special Committee's Retention  of UBS. In  defendants' discussion of UBS's

22 retention by the Special Committee on page 29 of the Proxy, defendants failed to disclose: (i) the .

23 exact amount of the "portion" of UBS's $3.2 million fee that is contingent on consummation of the

24 Proposed Acquisition; and (ii) whether UBS has previously rendered services for RAE and/or

25 Battery Ventures, and the fees paid to UBS for the same Without this information, shareholders

26 cannot assess whether UBS was motivated to give a particular fairness opinion for reasons other than

27 the merits of the Proposed Acquisition, and what weight, if any,  to place of the fairness opinion in

28 deciding whether to tender their shares.

60.	

The Individual Defendants were aware of their duty to disclose the foregoing material

2 information in the Proxy, and acted with at least negligence in failing to ensure that this material

3 information was disclosed in the Proxy. Absent disclosure of this material information, shareholders

4 are unable to make an informed decision whether to vote in favor of the Proposed Acquisition, and

5 are thus threatened with irreparable harm.

SELF-DEALING

7 61. By reason of their positions with RAE, the Individual Defendants have access to non-

9 public information concerning the financial condition and prospects of RAE. Thus, there exists an

9 imbalance and disparity of knowledge and economic power between the Individual Defendants and

10 . the public shareholders of RAE. Therefore, it is inherently unfair for the Individual Defendants to

I I execute and pursue any merger agreement under which they will reap disproportionate benefits to

1.2 the exclusion of obtaining the best value for shareholders. Instead, the Individual Defendants.

13 disloyally placed their own interests first, and tailored the terms and conditions of the Proposed

14 Acquisition to meet their own personal needs and objectives. Certain Individual Defendants are also

15 receiving lucrative change-in-control benefits.

16	

62.	

The Proposed Acquisition is wrongful, unfair, and Harmful to RAE's public

17 stockholders, and represents an effort by the Individual Defendants to aggrandize their own financial

18 position and interests at the expense of and to the detriment of Class members (as defined herein).

19 Specifically, defendants are attempting to deny plaintiff and the Class (as defined herein) their

20 shareholder rights through the sale of RAE via an unfair process. Accordingly, the Proposed

21 Acquisition will benefit the Individual Defendants at the expense of RAE's shareholders.

22 .	63.	

The Individual Defendants have also approved the Proposed Acquisition so that it

23 transfers 100% of RAE's unique assets, revenues, and profits to Battery Ventures, thus all of RAE's

24 operations will now accrue to the benefit of Battery Ventures.

25	

64.	

Defendants Chen and Hsi have negotiated for themselves a 30% interest in the go-

26 forward Company to the detriment of the Company's shareholders. Defendant Chen even negotiated

27 a position for his wife at the go-forward company. Defendants Chen and Hsi are attempting to

28. squeeze out the Company's public stockholders in order to obtain a larger equity interest in the go-

interests and their fiduciary obligation  to maximize stockholder value or, if
such conflicts exist, to ensure that all conflicts be resolved in the best
interests of RAE's public stockholders; and

solicit competing bids to Battery Ventures's offer to ensure that the
Company's shareholders are receiving the maximum value for their shares.

CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

66.	

Plaintiff brings this action for himself and on behalf of all holders of RAE common

14 stock which have been or will be harmed by the conduct described herein (the "Class"). Excluded

15 from the Class are the defendants and any individual or entity affiliated with any defendant.

16	

17	

67.	

68.	

This action is properly maintainable as a class action.

The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. According to

18 RAE's SEC filings, there were more than 59.4 million shares of RAE common stock outstanding as

19 of July 31, 2010.

20	

69.	

There are questions of law and fact which are common to the Class and which

21 predominate over questions affecting any individual Class member. The common questions include,

22 inter alia, the following:

23	

(a)	

whether the Individual Defendants have breached their fiduciary duties of

24 undivided loyalty, independence, or due care with respect to plaintiff and the other members of the

25 Class in connection with the Proposed Acquisition;

26	

(b)	

whether the Individual Defendants are engaging in self-dealing in connection

27 with the Proposed Acquisition;

28

-17- 

Case5:10-cv-04944-PVT Document1 Filed1 1/01/10 Page19 of 26

	1	

(c)	

whether the Individual Defendants have breached any oftheir other fiduciary

2 duties owed to plaintiff and the other members of the Class in connection with the Proposed

3 Acquisition, including the duties of good faith, diligence, and fair dealing;

4	

(d)	

whether RAE aided and abetted the Individual Defendants' breaches of

5 fiduciary duties;

6	

(e)	

whether Battery Ventures aided and abetted the Individual Defendants'

7 breaches of fiduciary duties; and

8	

(f)	

whether plaintiff and the other members of the Class would suffer irreparable

9 injury were the transactions complained of herein consummated.

10	

70.	

Plaintiffs claims are typical of the claims of the other members of the Class and

11 plaintiff does not have any interests adverse to the Class.

12	

71.	

Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in litigation of this nature and

13 will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the Class..

14	

72.	

The prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class would create

15 a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the Class which

16 would establish incompatible standards of conduct  for the party opposing the Class.

17	

73.	

Plaintiff anticipates that there will be no difficulty in the management of this

18 litigation. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication

19 of this controversy.

20	

74.	

Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the Class with respect to

21 the matters complained of herein, thereby making appropriate the relief sought herein with respect to

22 the Class as a whole.

The Individual Defendants and RAE disseminated the false and misleading Proxy

2 specified above, which famed to disclose material facts necessary in order to make the statements

3 made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

4	

77.	

The Proxy was prepared, reviewed, and/or disseminated by the Individual Defendants

5 and RAE. It misrepresented and/or omitted material facts, including material information about the

6 unfair sales process for the Company, the unfair consideration offered in the Proposed Acquisition,

7 and the actual intrinsic value of the Company's assets.

8	

78.	

In so doing, the Individual Defendants and RAE made untrue statements of material

9 facts and omitted to state material facts necessary to make the statements that were made not

10 misleading in violation of section 14(a) of the 1934 Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated

11 thereunder. By virtue of their positions within the Company, the Individual Defendants and RAE

12 were aware of this information and of their duty to disclose this information in the Proxy.

13	

79,	

The Individual Defendants and RAE were at least negligent in filing the Proxy with

14 these materially false and misleading statements..

15	

80.	

The omissions and false and misleading statements in the Proxy are material in that a

16 reasonable shareholder would consider them important in deciding how to vote on the Proposed

17 Acquisition. In addition, a reasonable investor would view a full and accurate disclosure as

18 significantly altering the "total mix" of information made available in the Proxy and in other

19 information reasonably available to shareholders.

20	

81.	

By reason of the foregoing, the Individual Defendants and RAE have violated section

21 14(a) of the 1934 Act and SEC Rule 14a-9(a) promulgated thereunder.

22	

82.	

Because of the false and misleading statements in the Proxy, plaintiff is threatened

23 with irreparable harm, rendering money damages inadequate. Therefore, injunctive relief is

24 appropriate to ensure defendants' misconduct is corrected.

Violation of Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act

5	

84.	

The Individual Defendants acted as controlling persons ofRAE within the meaning of

6 section 20(a) of the 1934 Act as alleged herein. By virtue of their positions as officers and/or

7 directors of RAE, and participation in and/or awareness ofthe Company's operations and/or intimate

8 knowledge of the false statements contained in the Proxy filed with the SEC, they had the power to

9 influence and control and did influence and control, directly or indirectly, the decision-making of the

10 Company, including the content and dissemination of the various statements which plaintiff contends

11 is false and misleading.

12	

85.	

Each of the Individual Defendants and RAE was provided with or had unlimited

1 3 access to copies. of the Proxy and other statements alleged by plaintiff to be misleading prior to

14 and/or shortly after these statements were issued and had the ability to prevent the issuance of the

15 statements or cause the statements to be corrected.

16	

86.	

In particular, each of the Individual Defendants had direct and supervisory

17 involvement in the day-to-day operations of the Company, and, therefore, is presumed to have had

1 8 the power to control or influence the particular transactions giving rise to the securities violations as

19 alleged herein, and exercised the same. The Proxy at issue contains the unanimous recommendation

20 of each of the Individual Defendants to approve the Proposed Acquisition. They were, thus, directly

21 involved in the making of this document.

22	

87.	

RAE also had direct supervisory control over composition of the Proxy and the

23 information disclosed therein., as well as the information that was omitted and/or misrepresented in

24 the Proxy. RAE, in fact, disseminated the Proxy and is, thus, directly responsible for materially

25 misleading shareholders because it permitted the materially misleading Proxy to be published to

26 shareholders.

27	

88.	

In addition, as the Proxy sets forth at length, and as described herein, the Individual

28 Defendants and RAE were each involved in negotiating, reviewing, and approving the Proposed

89.	

By virtue of the foregoing, the Individual Defendants and RAE have violated section

4 20(a) of the 1934 Act.

As set forth above, the Individual Defendants and RAE had the ability to exercise

6 control over and did control a person or persons who have each violated section 14(a) and SEC Rule

7 14a-9, by their acts and omissions as alleged herein. By virtue of their positions as controlling

8 persons, these defendants are liable pursuant to section 20(a) of the 1934 Act. As a direct and

Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation contained

92.	

The Individual Defendants have violated the fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, good

15 faith, and independence owed to the public shareholders of RAE and have acted to put their personal

16 interests ahead of the interests of RAE's shareholders.

17	

93.	

By the acts, transactions, and courses of conduct alleged herein, Individual

18 Defendants, individually and acting as a part of a common plan, are attempting to unfairly deprive

19 plaintiff and other members of the Class of the true value inherent in and arising from RAE.

(c)	

they ignored or did not protect against the numerous conflicts of interest

2 resulting from the directors' own interrelationships or connection with the Proposed Acquisition.

3	

96.	

Because the Individual Defendants dominate and control the business and corporate

4 affairs of RAE, and are in possession of, or have access to, private corporate information concerning

5 RAE's assets, business, and future prospects, there exists an imbalance and disparity of knowledge

6 and economic power between them and the public shareholders of RAE which makes it inherently

7 unfair for them to pursue and recommend any proposed acquisition wherein they will reap

8 disproportionate benefits to the exclusion of maximizing shareholder value.

9	

97.	

By reason of the foregoing acts, practices, and course of conduct, the Individual.'

10 Defendants have failed to exercise ordinary care and diligence in the exercise of their fiduciary.

I I obligations toward plaintiff and the other -members of the Class.

12	

98.	

Unless enjoined by this Court, the Individual Defendants will continue to breach  their.

13 fiduciary duties owed to plaintiff and the Class, and may consummate the Proposed Acquisition

14 which will exclude the Class from its fair share of RAE's valuable assets and operations, and/or

15 benefit defendants in the unfair manner complained of herein, all to the irreparable harm, of the

16 Class.

17	

99.	

The Individual Defendants are engaging in self-dealing, are not acting in good faith

18 toward plaintiff and the other members of the Class, and have breached and are breaching their

19 fiduciary duties to the members of the Class.

20	

100. As a result of the Individual Defendants' unlawful actions, plaintiff and the other

21 members of the Class will be irreparably harmed in that they will not receive their fair portion of the

22 value of RAE's assets and operations. Unless the Proposed Acquisition is enjoined  by the Court, the

23 Individual Defendants will continue to breach their fiduciary duties owed to plaintiff and the

24 members of the Class, will not engage in arm's-length negotiations on the Proposed Acquisition

25 terms and may consummate the Proposed Acquisition, all to the irreparable harm of the members of

26 the Class.
